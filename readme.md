The function checks if a word is a palindrome, by recursion.

It uses 2 base cases:

1. It first checks if the length of the word is less than 2 or is a space; if it is, it returns 'word is a palindrome'.

2. It checks if the first and last letters are different; if they are, it returns 'not a palindrome'.

It then trims the letters to the edge of the word, then recurses it, till it closes in on either of the base conditions.
